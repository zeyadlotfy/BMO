# BMO
visualization app in bfs technology
Graduated project for ODC-SWE
## Getting Started
This app implements BFS technology in c++ 
Through the BMO (robot), he searches for the shortest way to reach the exit gate
### Prerequisites
exe file opener

### Installing

dawnload mysetup.exe file 
and easily install it 

### Running 
There are a hundred cells for BMO( the robot) to move
Enter the BMO cell number, then enter the exit gate cell
Then, build the walls that will stand in the way of BMO
And, if there are cells that BMO cannot reach, the program will inform you
Then BMO will choose the shortest path he can get to the exit gate

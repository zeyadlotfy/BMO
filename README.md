visualization app in bfs technology

Graduated project for ODC-SWE
## Getting Started
This app implements BFS technology in c++ GUI

using .NET Framework with C++/CLI

Through the BMO (robot), he searches for the shortest way to reach the exit gate
### Prerequisites
exe file opener

### Installing

dawnload mysetup.exe file 
and easily install it 

### Running 
There are a hundred cells for BMO( the robot) to move

Enter the BMO cell number, then enter the exit gate cell

Then, build the walls that will stand in the way of BMO

And, if there are cells that BMO cannot reach, the program will inform you

Then BMO will choose the shortest path he can get to the exit gate
